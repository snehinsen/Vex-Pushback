# Vex Robotics Pushback software

This is the code base my and team and I are using for the software of our robot built for the 2025 game Vex Robotics Pushback.

This is the production bratch witch houses the proper cpp code my team and I are using for this project, that way the code is significantly more configureable. I have a passion for hating dev software that sucks.
