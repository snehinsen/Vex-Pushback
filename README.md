# Vex Robotics Pushback software

This is the brantch that exclusively holds the test file that my team and I use for quick testing of individual components, and adjustments before porting it over to the prod bratch, witch is in C++ instead of the v5python file shown here.

The Test.v5python is purely for testing components and driver settings.
